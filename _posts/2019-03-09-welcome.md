Welcome to the new home site for cachy, the cross-platform password protection system.

At the time of posting this we are a little under a month away from the intended release date of cachy. That being the weekend of April 6th, when we are hoping to have cachy available on both the Google Play and Windows stores.

We have a busy schedule and many things to do before then, but we are hoping that this date won't slip. So over the next few weeks, in the run-up to release, we will be providing more details, including making available full technical information on how cachy works and how it keeps your credentials private from prying eyes.

So please stay tuned!
