Unfortunately the release that had been planned for this weekend is to be delayed by another week, until the weekend of 13th/14th of April.

There's nothing to worry about, we just want to make sure that the first release is as good as can be, and as such, we have found a few glitches with new features that were added with this release that must really be addressed and thoroughly tested first.

We hope that you (whoever is waiting for cachy), understand and will join us next weekend.  We should have some screen shots and some technicaly documentation being uploaded in the mean time.

Thanks!
