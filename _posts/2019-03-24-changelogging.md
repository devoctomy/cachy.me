One think we want to make sure from day one, is that you know what to expect with each release of cachy.  That's where our inbuilt change logging comes in...

Obviously this is an extremely simple feature and we aren't expecting you to be blown away by this.  We just want you to be aware that every time we update cachy, we will include comprehensive details of what's changed.  Too many developers just include a single one-liner, such as "various tweaks and fixes", which let's face it, helps noone.

We want you to know if a bug you are experiencing has been fixed, or a new feature has been added.  You'll find the change log within the 'About' page.

Also just to remind you, we are aiming to "go gold" on April 6th 2019.  So watch this space...
