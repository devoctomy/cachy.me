This is just a brief update to let you know that cachy is still in the process of release.  Although we still aren't public in the Microsoft and Google Play stores yet, we are edging closer every day.

In the mean time we have been preparing for the release by building a knowledge base of helpful articles using our support desk (hosted with Freshdesk).  Take a look by clicking here [http://www.devoctomy.com/support](http://www.devoctomy.com/support).

cachy will be available real soon, we promise so thanks for sticking with us!
